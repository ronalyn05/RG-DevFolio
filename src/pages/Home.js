                {/* I'm an IT fresh graduate with a passion for software
                development. I'm a full-stack web developer with experience in
                building responsive and user-centric websites using ReactJS and
                NodeJS. */}
                As a newbie in the field, I focus on developing and executing
                test scripts, documenting issues, and collaborating with teams
                to ensure product quality gained through the companyâ€™s training
                courses and through coursework at bootcamp. While I donâ€™t have
                project experience yet, Iâ€™m continuously upskilling and growing
                my expertise in software testing through effective test
                automation and functional testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to my strong focus on testing, I am a full-stack web
                developer experienced in building responsive, user-centric
                websites using ReactJS and NodeJS, as well as ASP.Net Web
                Form-based applications gained through academic projects and
                internship. My background in backend development with C# further
                complements my skill set, enabling me to understand both the
                development and testing aspects of software projects.{" "}

                applications. I am continuously learning new languages and

                I am committed to delivering innovative solutions that exceed
                client expectations while driving technology initiatives to
                success. Continuous learning is essential to my approach, and I
                actively seek to expand my knowledge of programming languages
                and methodologies, including C#, C, Java, HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript.
